# resume-in-a-bottle

WIP

# Purpose
This project exists simply to continue pushing my own personal python skills, as well as to provide a simple way for people to self-host their own resume.

# Setup
Install uwsgi uwsgi-python-adapter and a bunch of other things that I haven't nailed down.

Copy (or symlink) the nonexistant wsgi configuration file into your apps-enabled directory, populate the (nonexistant) database with your information, and you're good to go!
